            I am currently enrolled in Ohio State's web development bootcamp program, and once finished will
            continue my education surrounding web development. I also have a BAS in Psychology from Ohio
            University.
            I plan on combining my fascination with Psychology, and passion for web development to become a
            leader in the web development workforce.
